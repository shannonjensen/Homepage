      <h5>While you are reading this, I am hopefully hiking the GR20 across Corsica, admiring the views and popping paracetamol, away from the internet. Due to the timing of my discovery of FAC, I only had one week to prepare all of the pre-requisites before my departure so this site remains rather sparse, but I will try to remedy that upon my return at the very end of July. I would absolutely love to join the October cohort and look forward to the opportunity to introduce myself. </h5>
